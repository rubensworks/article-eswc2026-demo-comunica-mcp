## Implementation
{:#implementation}

Comunica MCP SPARQL is a TypeScript/JavaScript project that exposes all functionalities of the [Comunica SPARQL querying framework](cite:cites comunica) through MCP.
It is open-source, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/comunica/comunica-feature-mcp/){:.mandatory}, npm, and is available under the MIT license.
Comunica is a modular SPARQL framwork that enables SPARQL querying over decentralized Knowledge Graphs.
This includes Knowledge Graphs exposed as [SPARQL endpoints](cite:cites spec:sparqlprot),
[Linked Data documents](cite:cites linkeddata) in any RDF representation, [TPF interfaces](cite:cites tpf), [HDT files](cite:cites hdt), [Solid pods](cite:cites solid), and more.
In contrast to GRASP, Comunica MCP SPARQL is exposed through the more flexible MCP instead of using direct function calling.
Furthermore, besides allowing the LLM agent to execute any possible SPARQL 1.2 query,
Comunica MCP SPARQL allows agents to provide one or more Knowledge Graph URLs to query over.
And if the AI agent does not know what URLs to start from,
[link traversal](cite:cites linktraversalfoundations,solidquery) can be used to discover relevant sources by following links.

Comunica MCP SPARQL is not the first MCP approach for SPARQL, but it has some notable differences to existing work.
Some SPARQL engine vendors have their own dedicated MCP servers, such as
[Jena](https://github.com/ramuzes/mcp-jena){:.mandatory},
[GraphDB](https://github.com/keonchennl/mcp-graphdb){:.mandatory},
and [Stardog](https://github.com/noahgorstein/mcp-server-stardog){:.mandatory}.
These MCP servers are tied to these systems, while Comunica MCP SPARQL works with any Knowledge Graph.
[RDF Explorer](https://github.com/emekaokoye/mcp-rdf-explorer){:.mandatory} and [SPARQL-MCP](cite:cites sparqlmcp) are not tied to specific Knowledge Graphs,
but in contrast to Comunica MCP SPARQL,
they only handles Knowledge Graphs exposed through SPARQL endpoints.
Among these two, SPARQL-MCP is the only one that also supports federation,
but in contrast to Comunica MCP SPARQL,
it requires the LLM agent to explicitly include `SERVICE` keywords within the query,
while Comunica enables automatic source selection.
Furthermore, all advanced features from Comunica are exposed through MCP,
such as HTTP proxy support, timeout settings, and authentication (e.g for updates).
